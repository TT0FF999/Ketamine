### On-Device MobileGestalt Editor for iOS

**Ketamine** is an on-device MobileGestalt editor that lets you modify supported system values directly from your iPhone — no PC required.

> ⚠️ **Experimental:** Many features in Ketamine are still untested across all devices and iOS versions. Things may not work as expected. Please report bugs, issues, and compatibility results in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/Wt8dj8E8ZN).

## Features

* 📱 Runs entirely on iPhone — no PC required
* 🛠️ MobileGestalt editing, sorted into Device, Display, System, Liquid Glass, iPad and Intelligence
* 📲 Device spoofing
* 🧠 **Siri AI Setup** — Apple Intelligence and Siri AI on supported iOS 27 builds, fully reversible
* 🖼️ PosterBoard support, with an in-app **Nugget-Wallpapers** gallery
* 🛡️ **Portable backups** — export your recovery point to Files/AirDrop and import it back
* 🍬 Eight alternate app icons
* 🎨 Accent colour picker

## Requirements

**iOS 26.0 or newer.** Tweaks and Siri AI Setup additionally require **iOS 27** — see the table below.

## Compatibility

| iOS Version | MobileGestalt Editing | Customization |
| ----------- | --------------------- | ----------- |
| iOS 18.x and earlier | ❌ Unsupported | ❌ Unsupported |
| iOS 26.0 – 26.6 | ❌ Unsupported | ✅ Supported |
| iOS 27.0 Beta 1 – Beta 4 | ✅ Supported | ✅ Supported |
| Later versions | ❌ Patched | ❌ Unsupported |

> **Note:** On iOS 26, the exploit does not provide the access required for MobileGestalt editing, so tweaks are unavailable. PosterBoard may still work, but compatibility has not been fully verified.

> **Siri AI Setup is beta.** It can cause instability, boot loops, or require a device restore, and the **Siri AI** mode in particular is the least reliable feature in Ketamine — it may have no effect at all. Every key it touches is saved first, so its changes can be reverted. Back up before using it.
